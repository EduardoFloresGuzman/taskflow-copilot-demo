# TaskFlow Development Instructions for GitHub Copilot

You are working on TaskFlow, a Next.js 15 todo application. Follow these specific guidelines:

## Component Conventions
- Use PascalCase for component names, kebab-case for file names
- All components should be TypeScript functional components with proper JSDoc comments
- Export as named exports, not default exports

## Styling Guidelines
- Use only TailwindCSS classes
- Follow the design system colors: Primary #2563eb, Secondary #64748b, Success #059669, Warning #d97706, Error #dc2626
- Use Inter font family
- Apply consistent spacing using 4px base units

## State Management
- Use React hooks for local state, Context API for shared state
- Follow the exact interfaces defined in src/types/index.ts
- All state changes should update the updatedAt timestamp

## Accessibility Requirements
- Always include proper ARIA labels
- Maintain 4.5:1 color contrast
- Ensure full keyboard navigation support
- Add descriptive alt text for images

## Import Organization
- Order imports as: External libraries → Internal modules → Relative imports
- Use absolute imports with @/ prefix for src/ directory

## Error Handling
- Wrap localStorage operations in try-catch blocks
- Validate user inputs according to specifications (title max 100 chars, description max 500 chars)

## Performance Optimization
- Use React.memo for components that receive complex props
- Implement proper useCallback and useMemo for expensive operations
- Avoid unnecessary re-renders
